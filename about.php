                <h2>The Story Behind This App</h2>



                <p>I've played Lords Mobile Game for a long time, thus I've encountered a lot of problems like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not meeting the requirements of events.</li>
                    <li>Searching a lot about the time in my friends' country.</li>
                    <li>Being unable to know which quests should I take to achieve the points, etc ...</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When I reached the age of 21, I've decided to become a developer, I started this project as a CLI script that runs in the powershell.</p>
                <p>Now, It's a user-friendly website, and it has a lot more features than the old version, so, it's not an application for money or something.</p>


                <p>This application is for free, I don't get anything in return, it was created to help me and others in the first place, and, of course this how I can practice my job as a developer.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Ahmed Osman, I'm a self-taught developer from Egypt.</p>

                <p>I'm now 22 years old, but I'm playing Lords Mobile since I was 18 years old.</p>
                <p>So, I'm about to complete 5 years playing this awesome game, but, In real life we have a lot of things to take care of.</p>


                <p>This might block you from doing well in the game, because maybe you're doing something more important such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Studying for school.</li>
                    <li>Busy in your job.</li>
                    <li>Taking care of your family.</li>
                    <li>Maybe just not in the mood.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In fact, there will be a lot of reasons, and the game is just something that's supposed to be at your free time, I'm talking from a "free to play" player prespective.</p>
                <p>Thus, I came with an idea to make my gaming experience easier, and not to allow the game to exhaust me while trying to meet the requirements for my guild</p>
                <p>This is not only the reason, since I'm a free-to-play gamer, I have to get some gifts.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Idea</h2>
                <p>My idea was, to make a program that can help me determine:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Which tasks should I take in GF event</li>
                    <li>How many resources should I gather in KVK event</li>
                    <li>Know what's the time in my guild's country, so I don't miss events with them, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Finally, this idea has been turned into a real application, so, I and anyone else can use.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>For Who?</h2>

                <p>I think it's obvious that this app is designed for free 2 play gamers, since if you're a pay 2 play player, you can finish any of these requirements easily within a short time.</p>
                <h5>But you still can use it</h5>
                <p>In fact, the application can be useful for pay 2 play gamers as well, because, sometimes p2p players have to gather resources, when they are not safe to fight.</p>
                <p>As well as using the <a href="timezone">timezone tool</a>, it's for everyone, even for non-players at all.</p>
            </section>



            <section>
                <h2>Enjoy & Play Easier</h2>
                <p>I hope you enjoy this app, and enjoy your game as well, and I really wish that this app makes your life easier, specially F2P players who suffer a lot in this game.</p>
